# assignment-5-cicd
This repository holds the starter code for assignment 5, in which we practice the fundamentals of CI/CD.

I linked this repo to netlify with
netlify link
and then setup the enviorment variables with 
netlify env:set


This is basically just a clone of my assignment 2. Here is the netlify link.
